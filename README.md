This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest and Puppeteer for end-to-end browser testing.

### Run the test suite

The test suite will automatically start and stop the Next.js dev server as needed. Simply run:

```bash
npx jest
```

or to run a specific test file:

```bash
npx jest src/app/__tests__/page.puppeteer.test.ts
```

Test output will indicate pass/fail status for each test.
